### Overview ###
There are several way to initiliaze a git repository. The first is used to initialize git in an existing repository. The second is used to retrieve an existing repository.

To initialize a new project, in the project directory, initialize the git repository with:
```
git init
```

This will enable git to keep track of changes in this folder, and subfolders by creating a .git hidden folder containing the git skeleton.
The second way is:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```
This will clone the repository containing the documents of this tutorial.
